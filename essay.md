# Interactive Essay

> Note: From here you and your team can add more paragraphs to complete the

</li>
</ol>

**Read the Essay and Reorganize It**

Group members then read the existing essay, which is broken down into blocks based on paragraphs. Then they arrange the blocks in the order they think they should be, making sure to leave comments to inform the other team members of why they placed paragraphs where they did. Students then save, and allow the next team member to do the same.

**View History**

Students have the ability to view their essay’s edit history, allowing them to see a complete list of who made edits and when.

**Add and Delete Paragraphs**

If students determine that a paragraph is missing, they can type and submit a new paragraph block. Conversely, if students determine that a paragraph doesn’t fit, they can delete the paragraph block.

**Call it Complete**

Once all team members are in agreement that the essay is complete, they simply need to inform their professor.
