# # Intro to the Lumina Foundation Experiential Learning Assignments

## The Concept:

Create a Cookbook to serve as a guide for designing, implementing, and assessing virtual experiential learning assignments in order to increase student access to quality experiential learning material.

## Plan for this project:

Develop four virtual experiential learning assignments to allow students to virtually experience projects that were previously only possible in person. The assignments focus on allowing students to virtually collaborate to build and restructure essays, receive tangible feedback on persuasive speeches, turn their paper presentation poster into a robust online presentation, and simulate first-hand experience of what it is like to lead a team on a dangerous adventure.
