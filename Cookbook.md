# Intro to the Lumina Foundation Experiential Learning Assignments

## Concept:

Create a Cookbook to serve as a guide for designing, implementing, and assessing virtual experiential learning assignments in order to increase student access to quality experiential learning material.

## Project Plan:

Develop four virtual experiential learning assignments to allow students to virtually experience projects that were previously only possible in person. The assignments focus on allowing students to virtually collaborate to build and restructure essays, receive tangible feedback on persuasive speeches, turn their paper presentation poster into a robust online presentation, and simulate first-hand experience of what it is like to lead a team on a dangerous adventure.

# Project Ingredients

## Process

### Considerations

* Faculty
 * Previous experience with online and/or virtual environments required
 * They should have ideas for developing good virtual experiential learning assignments
 * They should structure assignments around a virtual experiential learning activity
* Logistics
 * Demographics
   * Universities need to determine their demographics (faculty & student) to isolate the target market that they aim to create the project for
 * Access to technology and web development
   * Web, design, and/or game development software will be necessary to create an experiential learning assignment
 * Goals
   * Each experiential learning assignment needs to have a clear project management plan and a defined desired outcome
 * A timeline and benchmarks
   * It is necessary to set clear deadlines for specific tasks and to measure progress
* Turn concepts into minimum viable products
 * Create a product that has enough features and functions to be useful to early users
 * Fail faster
   * Do not hesitate to create a alpha version to begin testing internally
   * Use early testing to learn, adapt, and create a better beta version quicker
   * Then use early beta testing to learn, adapt, and create a better final product
 * Test often
   * Test the assignments frequently with faculty and students
 * Create critical paths for functional success and severe failures
   * Determine the sequence of dependent tasks that form the straightest route to success
   * Then determine the point at which would be determined failure
 * SMART goals
   * Set goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-based
 * Review costs and resources
   * Determine your level of technical skills, budget, timeframe, and access to the necessary tools
 * Ask the critical questions
   * What are the goals and objectives of the assignment?
   * What’s important to the Instructor?
   * What should the student learn?
   * How should it make the students feel?
* Empathy research
 * Experience mapping
   * Create separate thought process maps that illustrate how students, faculty, and developers will experience the assignment
   * Use these maps to determine the sequence of events

* Do not let technology be a barrier
 * Align the assignment with the technology’s strengths
 * Virtualize hands-on activities
 * Prioritize student-to-student interaction
* Collaborate with faculty
 * Seek out suggestions from faculty involved in this project
 * Actively find ways to get feedback
   * “I was skeptical at first, but...”
   * “I should have planned better for...”
   * “My students’ experiences and outcomes from virtual EL were...”
 * Be open to change
* Technology and design limitations
 * The tiered system can not always be applied, for example:
   * Some assignments may not have a cheaper, less complex that already exists to build from, but instead requires it be created from scratch

# The Tier System

This system breaks experiential learning assignments up into three levels of tiers by their difficulty and amount of resources needed. Tiers are used to provide clarity into how to scale the assignment based around the technical skills, cost, time, complexity, and tools that are available.

Using the tier system will help universities set the amount of resources, time, personnel that they will need to create the assignment.

## Criteria

**Technical Skills**
The staff available with the needed abilities and knowledge to perform the required tasks.

**Cost**
The financial burden associated with completing the required tasks. Does anything need to be purchased? How much does it cost? What are the operational costs, such as software, servers, and production hours?

**Time**
The time required to plan, develop, test, evaluate, and maintain the assignment.

**Complexity**
How difficult it is to achieve the desired result.

**Tools**
The number of tools that need to be developed or used to implement the assignment.

| **Tiers**
**(Subject to Change)** |  |  |  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Tier 1** | **       Tier 2** | **Tier 3** | 
| **Technical Skill** | Low | Proficient | Expert | 
| **Cost** | Free to low | Subscription Services | Enterprise
Services | 
| **Time** | 0 - 10 hours | 11 - 35 hours | 36+ Hours | 
| **     Complexity** | Simple | Moderate | High | 
| **Tools** | 0 - 1 | 2 - 3 | 4 + | 

## The Tiers of our assignments:
* **Digital Poster** - A tier 1 project due to the fact it is simple and had a time requirement under 10 hours
* **Persuasive Speech** - A tier 2 project due to its development time being in the 11-35 hour range
* **Interactive Essay** - A tier 2 project due to its development time being in the 11-35 hour range
* **Forward **- A tier 3 project due to its development time of 36+ hours

# Expected Outcome Assessment

### Were these outcomes obtained?

* Provided a collaborative experience for faculty and students
* Engineered an experience with opportunities for faculty to mentor students
 * Supported faculty in their efforts to enhance learning inside and outside of the classroom
   * Brought research about facilitating learning to the attention of the university community
   * Advocated and recognized teaching excellence
   * Acted as a resource for faculty as they planned, implemented, enhanced, and assessed student learning
   * Promoted the teacher-scholar model of faculty excellence within UCO’s ethos of providing transformative learning opportunities for our students

# Digital Poster

This tool allows students to take their poster design and turn it into its own presentation. Giving them the ability to add text, pictures, links, and videos to tell their story for them.

## **Concept**

Professor Trevor Cox came up with Digital Poster for his Organizational Leadership Capstone course. His goal was to take the existing poster presentation assignment being done on actual poster paper and make it virtual.

## How it Works
Insert your poster image
A student inserts a link to the poster image that they created to serve as the background for their poster presentation.

### Add your content
The student then uses Digital Poster to add annotation boxes wherever they desire. They then fill those boxes with the text, images, links, and videos they need in order to effectively present their topic.

### Publish your poster
The student then finalizes their poster presentation, receives a link to their web hosted poster, and then shares the link with their peers and professor. With that link, they can experience the poster presentation and explore it while allowing the poster to present itself.

# **Persuasive Speech **
This tool allows the students to upload a speech and get tangible feedback from their peers. The audience members will use a voting feature embedded into the video player to let the instructor and student speakers know how persuasive they were.

## Concept
Professor Jennifer Foster Came up with Persuasive Speech for her course by the same title, Persuasive Speech. The goal was to recreate the in person experience of giving a speech and receiving tangible feedback in a virtual environment.

## How it Works

### Record and upload a speech
Students record themselves giving their speech. They then upload their video to YouTube to host the video. Next they enter their YouTube link into Persuasive Speech, which will create a presenter page and an audience page.

### View other student’s audience page
Students visit their peers’ audience page which starts by telling them a topic and asking them to rate their initial opinion on the topic. The student watches the speech and then sees the same scale to give their final opinion on the topic.

### View your own presenter page
Students then visit their own presenter page to see tangible data on how persuasive their peers found their speech. Data is created by comparing initial opinions and final opinions.

# Forward
A leadership simulation where teams of four work together and use their role-specific skills to get their team to the summit of a challenging mountain. Students will need to communicate with each other as they assess the ever-changing situation, make role-specific decisions, determine how their decisions affect the team, and decide how their team will travel in order to reach the summit safely and on-time.

## Concept
Professor Trevor Cox came up with Forward for his Foundations of Organizational Leadership course. His goal was to take a role playing assignment generally done in person and turn it into an interactive leadership simulating video game.

## **How it Works**

### Teams of four select their roles
Each team member must select a different role, and can choose from medic, meteorologist, navigator, and thrill seeker.

### Players make decisions
Each player makes one role-specific decision each round, making sure to communicate with their teammates to make the best decision possible.

### Leader decides how to travel
The leader sees the decisions each team member has made, communicates with the team to discuss what to do, and then submits their choice to determine if their team climbs up the mountain, stays at the current camp, or travels back down the mountain.

### Players assess their situation
Once a new turn begins, all players will be taken to the progress report where they can see the result of their most recent choice, the location of each team member, and other basic information.

### Learn, adapt, and climb
When the next turn begins the cycle starts again as players attempt to work together to get as many team members to reach the top of the mountain as they can.

# Interactive Essay
A tool that allows students to work collaboratively to manipulate an essay to learn and thrive at essay structure. Students collaboratively edit the same essay while participating in discussion to determine the best placement for each paragraph.

## Concept

Professor Shay Rahm came up with Interactive Essay with the goal of taking a generally lecture-heavy assignment and turning it into a collaborative, hands-on virtual experience.

# How it Works

### Open your essay
Each group will be assigned a different existing essay. (Alternatively, this assignment can be altered to also require the students to initially write the essay in Interactive Essay.

### Read the essay and reorganize it
Each group member then reads the existing essay, which is broken into blocks consisting of different paragraphs. They then move the paragraph blocks to the location they believe it should be, making sure to leave comments to inform the other team member of why they placed paragraphs where they did. Students then save, and allow the next team member to do the same.

### View history
Students have the ability to view their essay’s edit history. By doing so they can see a complete list of who made edits and when.

### Add and delete paragraphs
If students determine that a paragraph doesn’t fit, they can delete the paragraph block. If students determine that a paragraph is missing, they can type and submit a new paragraph block.

### Call it complete
Once all team members are in agreement that the essay is complete, they simply need to inform their professor.

# Surveys

## Methodology
Surveys were designed to measure the functionality and enjoyment of using the interactive tools as well as the learning experience and efficacy. Surveys were distributed to students as well as instructors to provide a basis of comparison and possible improvement. The surveys were designed to be short and easy to complete with few open response questions for ease of student completion as well as analysis. The first round of surveys were only sent to students who had used the innovative tool. In the future, surveys will also be sent to students who did not use the tool as a control group.

## Tools
* Google Forms for surveys
* Google Sheets for responses.

Google was used for the ease of recording responses to the same Google Sheet for the purposes of analysis. Instructors distributed the survey to students.

## Example Questions
1. *The instructions were clear and helpful.*
Response Options:
1 (Strongly DIsagree) - 4 (Strongly Agree)

2. *The Digital Poster was easy to use.*
Response Options:
1 (Strongly DIsagree) - 4 (Strongly Agree)

3. *Building a Digital Poster was enjoyable.*
Response Options:
1 (Strongly DIsagree) - 4 (Strongly Agree)

4. *Interacting with other students’ Digital Poster presentations was a positive experience.*
Response Options:
1 (Strongly DIsagree) - 4 (Strongly Agree)

5. *The Digital Poster tool improved my learning experience over a traditional assignment.*
Response Options:
1 (Strongly DIsagree) - 4 (Strongly Agree)

6. *If given the option, I’d choose to use the Digital Poster tool again.*
Response Options:
1 (Strongly DIsagree) - 4 (Strongly Agree)

7. *What was your favorite part of the Digital Poster tool?*

8. *What was your least favorite part of the Digital Poster tool?*

9. *Was there anything you wanted to do that the Digital Poster tool wouldn’t let you do?*

10. *What else would you like to share?*

## Survey Results

### Persuasive Speech Surveys:
A survey that will be given to students who have used the initial version of the Persuasive Speech tool to collect feedback on how it worked, how they perceived the experience, and how they think it can be improved.

The first round of results indicated the persuasive essay tool was useful, but difficult to understand. Suggesting a “How to” video may be necessary upon its completion. The majority of students would choose to use the Persuasive Speech tool again.

### Digital Poster Surveys
The instructor who took the survey overall believed that the digital poster was helpful, though it allowed the students to use far too many mediums and students found technical difficulties compared to Google slides. Half of the students who filled out surveys indicated they would prefer to use the Digital Poster again while others would prefer Google Slides or PowerPoint.
