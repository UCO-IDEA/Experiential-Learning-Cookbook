# The Tier System

This system breaks experiential learning assignments up into three levels of tiers by their difficulty and amount of resources needed. Tiers are used to provide clarity into how to scale the assignment based around the technical skills, cost, time, complexity, and tools that are available.

Using the tier system will help universities set the amount of resources, time, and personnel that they will need to create the assignment.

## Criteria

**Technical Skills:**
The staff available with the needed abilities and knowledge to perform the required tasks.

**Cost:**
The financial burden associated with completing the required tasks. Does anything need to be purchased? How much does it cost? What are the operational costs, such as software, servers, and production hours?

**Time:**
Time is required to plan, develop, test, evaluate, and maintain the assignment. Does your personell have the capacity for this?

**Complexity:**
How difficult it is to achieve the desired result?

**Tools:**
The number of tools that need to be developed or used to implement the assignment. How many tools will be useful for students?
