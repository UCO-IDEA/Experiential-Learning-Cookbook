Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/UCO-IDEA/ExperientialLearningCookbook/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
