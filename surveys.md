# Surveys

## **Methodology**
Surveys were designed to measure the functionality and enjoyment of using the interactive tools as well as the learning experience and efficacy. Surveys were distributed to students as well as instructors to provide a basis of comparison and possible improvement. The surveys were designed to be short and easy to complete with few open response questions for ease of student completion as well as analysis. The first round of surveys were only sent to students who had used the innovative tool. In the future, surveys will also be sent to students who did not use the tool as a control group.

## **Tools**
* Google Forms for surveys
* Google Sheets for responses.

Google was used for the ease of recording responses to the same Google Sheet for the purposes of analysis. Instructors distributed the survey to students.

## **Survey Results**

### Persuasive Speech Surveys
<br>
A survey that will be given to students who have used the initial version of the Persuasive Speech tool to collect feedback on how it worked, how they perceived the experience, and how they think it can be improved.

The first round of results indicated the persuasive essay tool was useful, but difficult to understand. Suggesting a “How to” video may be necessary upon its completion. The majority of students would choose to use the Persuasive Speech tool again.

### Digital Poster Surveys
<br>
The instructor who took the survey overall believed that the digital poster was helpful, though it allowed the students to use far too many mediums and students found technical difficulties compared to Google slides. Half of the students who filled out surveys indicated they would prefer to use the Digital Poster again while others would prefer Google Slides or PowerPoint.
