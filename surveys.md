# Surveys

 **Methodology**

In order to measure functionality, enjoyment, learning experience, and efficacy, surveys were distributed to students as well as instructors (for a basis of comparison). The surveys were designed to be short and easy to complete with few open response questions for ease of student completion as well as analysis. The first round of surveys were only sent to students who had used the innovative tool. In the future, surveys will also be sent to students who did not use the tool as a control group.

**Tools**

* Google Forms for surveys
* Google Sheets for responses

Google was used for the ease of recording responses to the same Google Sheet for the purposes of analysis. Instructors distributed the survey to students.
