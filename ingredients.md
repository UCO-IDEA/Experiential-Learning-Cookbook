# Project Ingredients

## **Process Considerations**

* **Faculty**
   * Previous experience with online and/or virtual environments required
   * They should have ideas for developing good virtual experiential learning assignments
   * They should structure assignments around a virtual experiential learning activity
 * **Demographics**
   * Universities need to determine their demographics (faculty & student) to isolate the target market that they aim to create the project for

* **Logistics**
   * Access to technology and web development
   * Web, design, and/or game development software will be necessary to create an experiential learning assignment
 * **Goals**
   * Each experiential learning assignment needs to have a clear project management plan and a defined desired outcome
 * **Timeline and benchmarks**
   * It is necessary to set clear deadlines for specific tasks and to measure progress
    * Turn concepts into minimum viable products
   * Create a product that has enough features and functions to be useful to early users
 * **Fail faster**
   * Do not hesitate to create a alpha version to begin testing internally
   * Use early testing to learn, adapt, and create a better beta version quicker
   * Then use early beta testing to learn, adapt, and create a better final product
 * **Test often**
   * Test the assignments frequently with faculty and students
   * Create critical paths for functional success and severe failures
   * Determine the sequence of dependent tasks that form the straightest route to success
   * Then determine the point at which would be determined failure
 * **SMART goals**
   * Set goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-based
 * **Review costs and resources**
   * Determine your level of technical skills, budget, timeframe, and access to the necessary tools
 * **Ask the critical questions**
   * What are the goals and objectives of the assignment?
   * What’s important to the Instructor?
   * What should the student learn?
   * How should it make the students feel?
* **Empathy research**
 * **Experience mapping**
   * Create separate thought process maps that illustrate how students, faculty, and developers will experience the assignment
   * Use these maps to determine the sequence of events

* **Do not let technology be a barrier**
   * Align the assignment with the technology’s strengths
 * **Virtualize hands-on activities**
  * **Prioritize student-to-student interaction**
* **Collaborate with faculty**
   * Seek out suggestions from faculty involved in this project
   * Actively find ways to get feedback
     * “I was skeptical at first, but...”
     * “I should have planned better for...”
     * “My students’ experiences and outcomes from virtual EL were...”
* ## **Be open to change**

   * The tiered system can not always be applied, for example:
   * Some assignments may not have a cheaper, less complex that already exists to build from, but instead requires it be created from scratch
