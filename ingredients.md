# Project Ingredients

## Process Considerations

**Faculty**

* Faculty is required to have previous experience with online and/or virtual environments.
* Faculty should have ideas for developing good virtual experiential learning assignments.
* Faculty should structure assignments around a virtual experiential learning activity.
  
**Logistics**

* Demographics
  * Universities need to determine their demographics (faculty & student) to isolate their target market.
* Access to technology and web development
  * Web, design, and/or game development software will be necessary to create an experiential learning assignment.
* Goals
  * Each experiential learning assignment needs to have a clear project management plan and a defined desired outcome.
* A timeline and benchmarks
  * It is necessary to set clear deadlines for specific tasks and to measure progress.
  
**Turn Concepts into Minimum Viable Products**

* Create a product that has enough features and functions to be useful to early users.
* Fail faster
  * Do not hesitate to create an alpha version to begin testing internally.
  * Use early testing to learn, adapt, and create a better beta version quicker.
  * Then use early beta testing to learn, adapt, and create a better final product.
* Test often
  * Test the assignments frequently with faculty and students.
* Create critical paths for functional success and severe failures.
  * Determine the sequence of dependent tasks that form the straightest route to success.
  * Then determine the point at which would be considered failure
* SMART goals.
  * Set goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-based.
* Review costs and resources
  * Determine your level of technical skills, budget, timeframe, and access to the necessary tools.
  * Ask the critical questions, such as:
    * Do we have the technical skills needed to achieve this project?
    * Can we gain access to the necessary subscription services?
    * Can the project be completed in the time available?
* What are the goals and objectives of the assignment?
  * What’s important to the instructor?
  * What should the student learn?
  * How should it make the students feel?
  
**Empathy Research**

* Experience mapping
  * Create separate thought process maps that illustrate how students, faculty, and developers will experience the assignment.
  * Use these maps to determine the sequence of events.

**Do Not Let Technology Be a Barrier**

* Align the assignment with the technology’s strengths
* Virtualize hands-on activities
* Prioritize student-to-student interaction
  
**Collaborate with Faculty**

* Seek out suggestions from faculty involved in this project
* Actively find ways to get feedback
  * “I was skeptical at first, but...”
  * “I should have planned better for...”
  * “My students’ experiences and outcomes from virtual EL were...”
* Be open to change

**Technology and Design Limitations**

* The tiered system cannot always be applied, for example:
  * Some assignments may not have a cheaper, less complex that already exists to build from, but instead requires it be created from scratch.
